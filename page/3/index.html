                <p>When Am I Going to Use This Rebecca Eggenschwiler on the crux of the matter. Students never really ask &ldquo;when am I going to use this?&rdquo; honestly:
 And the question itself — &ldquo;When am I going to use this?&rdquo; — is nearly always a lie, a front. The asker is not genuinely contemplating the use-value of Material X; rather, he or she is merely announcing the intent to give up.</p>

Although #AcWriMo does not begin until November, often in this final week of October, blogs, academic websites and e-journals begin posting on the theme, writing up tips on how to take advantage of #AcWriMo. This year, now that I recently begun my dissertation prospectus and studying for a prelim exam on international politics, I wanted to jump start my writing by making a public commitment to regular writing during November.</p>

                <p>Social constructivism, a research school found largely in international relations, should also aid identity politics research. No doubt it may seem malapropos to import a research agenda used largely to investigate questions of inter-state behavior, international security, and the like. However, the methods employed by the social theorists are simply those: social science methods. As such, when applicable, researchers should borrow and adapt whatever methods helps them investigate the questions driving their research.</p>

                <p>Would a conference by any other name smell as sweet? Last week the American Political Science Association (APSA) cancelled it annual conference which was to be held in New Orleans because of Hurricane/Tropical Storm Isaac. As as result, thousands of faculty, ABD interviewees, and other attendees suddenly had to think about practical implications of a year without the major conference. In their announcement about the cancellation, APSA suggested that all papers uploaded to SSRN (a public database where scholarly papers can be downloaded), would count for purposes of CV inclusion.</p>

                <p>Identity politics as I have always understood it strives to highlight the forms of domination against communities and classes of people who have been systematically marginalized and oppressed. It aims to right those injustices by privileging modes of discourse of the marginalized against the historically privileged (White Males first and foremost). But in countering injustice, do the advocates for social justice go too far?
Writing at Bitch Media, Sharday Mosurinjohn seems to think so.</p>

                <p>Western moral ethics has a long tradition of protecting the innocent. At least since the Christian teaching to care for the least among us (Mt 24:40), ethicists have advocated that the responsibility to protect takes a variety of forms, including a central concern for those who are suffering beyond the borders of one&rsquo;s nations. It should not surprise us then, that the strife in Syria and recent “Kony 2012” video have captured the attention of liberal and conservative alike.</p>
