                <p>Things are getting interesting. As it happens, I assigned students in my course on Grand Strategy broad regions of the globe for which they are responsible: South East Asia, Europe, Latin America, etc. One of their big assignments is a Marshall brief on the region. But they have to give up dates during the term. So we&rsquo;ve all been watching this pandemic unfold in more or less real time as it spreads from China to Asia to Europe and the like.</p>

                <p>Earlier this month I defended my dissertation and submitted all paperwork to complete my PhD. It has been a long time coming and I am obviously glad to be finished. My dissertation examined the development of international religious freedom and U.S. foreign policy during the Cold War. In it I make a very simple claim that efforts to promote religious freedom have been present in American national security strategy for much longer than most realize.</p>

                <p>A different introduction to Government This semester I decided to take a different approach to the early introduction to my American government class, really for all my teaching. I usually begin my classes with something I call &ldquo;the mini-lecture&rdquo;, a short 5 minute (or less) outline of a key concept that doesn&rsquo;t actually fit within the confines of the material but which will help the students learn to grasp the materials easier or produce better academic work overall.</p>

I don&rsquo;t normally post about process or things related to my workflow because, having tried in the past, have concluded that it is more of a procrastination tactic than anything else. Even my post about switching to Hugo for webhosting was written for me rather than anyone else.

                <p>I will be in Orange County, CA and Seattle, WA the last week of May and first week of June conducting field work for my dissertation. Should be fun &ldquo;practicing history without a license&rdquo; as my co-chair is fond of saying. But in truth, I think good empirical research on foreign policy needs archival work now more than ever. I can only show so much with a formal model or regression; as important as those are to rigorous social science, getting into the historical weeds is equally as essential because it shows us which of the variables we thought were important actually are.</p>

Student Activity Center (SAC), Room 1.106
Cryptocurrencies and the decentralized computing networks that power them, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, have become a global phenomenon. The problem is, most people, including policymakers, don&rsquo;t have a deep understanding of how these new networks operate, what they can do, and what risks and opportunities they present.
Peter Van Valkenburgh, Research Director at Coin Center, will explain how cryptocurrencies work, examine the many policy issues they raise, and discuss the future of this innovative yet disruptive technology.</p>
