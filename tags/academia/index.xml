      <description>This is not a workflow post. I don&amp;rsquo;t normally post about process or things related to my workflow because, having tried in the past, have concluded that it is more of a procrastination tactic than anything else. Even my post about switching to Hugo for webhosting was written for me rather than anyone else.
You don&amp;rsquo;t care about my workflow. You have your own. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to know how I produce what I do.</description>

      <description>Heading to &amp;lsquo;Frisco for APSA this week.^[NB: I use this term &amp;lsquo;frisco&amp;rsquo; not without some reservation as I know locals of San Francisco loath it with a fiery passion of a 1000 suns. But as a native of Southern California, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist.] Not much planned save for flurry of job market interviews and meetings with old colleagues, advisors, and friends. To be sure, I planned this trip not without some degree of trepidation.</description>
