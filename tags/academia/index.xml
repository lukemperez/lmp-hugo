      <description>This is not a workflow post. I don&amp;rsquo;t normally post about process or things related to my workflow because, having tried in the past, have concluded that it is more of a procrastination tactic than anything else. Even my post about switching to Hugo for webhosting was written for me rather than anyone else.
You don&amp;rsquo;t care about my workflow. You have your own. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to know how I produce what I do.</description>

      <description>Heading to &amp;lsquo;Frisco for APSA this week.1 Not much planned save for flurry of job market interviews and meetings with old colleagues, advisors, and friends. To be sure, I planned this trip not without some degree of trepidation. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot of money to plan for a conference and since I&amp;rsquo;m not presenting, I am ineligible for reimbursement within my department. Of course, I suspect this job market project is similar to nearly any field: new suit, flights, hotels, etc.</description>
