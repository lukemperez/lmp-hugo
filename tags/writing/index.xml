      <description>I missed the news in late-August that Howard Becker had passed away
A phenomenal social scientist. Not mentioned in his obit is that many who have never read is scholarly work have poured over and dog eared is, arguably magisterial, writing for social scientists, Writing for Social Scientists, Third Edition, recently reissued and updated.
I happened to re-read it earlier this year. After reading the obit over the weekend, I flipped through the book to look at my annotations.</description>

      <description>Last week I presented a best practices workshop on project management for my fellow graduate students. The purpose was to provide younger students in the program with ideas and concepts for managing projects &amp;ldquo;from idea to publication&amp;rdquo;.

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s Write The hashtags for #NaNoWriMo (National Novel Write Month) are starting to populate my twitter feed; yet conspicuously absent thus far are those for academics, affectionately hacked to #AcWriMo. Although #AcWriMo does not begin until November, often in this final week of October, blogs, academic websites and e-journals begin posting on the theme, writing up tips on how to take advantage of #AcWriMo. This year, now that I recently begun my dissertation prospectus and studying for a prelim exam on international politics, I wanted to jump start my writing by making a public commitment to regular writing during November.</description>
