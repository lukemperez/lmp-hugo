      <description>This is more a place-mark for myself when I invariably need to re-source the tutorials.
Halfway through 2021, Github changed how users interact with the service in the command line. Instead of authenticating through a username and password, users must now use a Personal Access Token. The upsides in the aggregate are plenty, but mostly centering on better security for everyone. The downside, for infrequent users of Github are that I need to update all my repos.</description>

      <description>Earlier this month I defended my dissertation and submitted all paperwork to complete my PhD. It has been a long time coming and I am obviously glad to be finished.

In it I make a very simple claim that efforts to promote religious freedom have been present in American national security strategy for much longer than most realize.</description>
