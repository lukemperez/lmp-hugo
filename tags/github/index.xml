      <description>This is more a place-mark for myself when I invariably need to re-source the tutorials.
Halfway through 2021, Github changed how users interact with the service in the command line. Instead of authenticating through a username and password, users must now use a Personal Access Token. The upsides in the aggregate are plenty, but mostly centering on better security for everyone. The downside, for infrequent users of Github are that I need to update all my repos.</description>

      <description>My 2010 Macbook Pro finally died. I was hoping to get one more year so I could finish the PhD on the same machine I began it with, but alas. While setting up my new machine, I realized how much I benefited from having my .emacs file on GitHub. So here&amp;rsquo;s a link in case anyone finds it helpful. A note of caution that it is a work-in-progress and some of the features are not fully active (like RefTeX) but I&amp;rsquo;ve been too busy with the dissertation to fix it.</description>
