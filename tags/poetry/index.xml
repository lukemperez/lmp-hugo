      <description>A PROMISE to California,
Also to the great Pastoral Plains, and for Oregon:
Sojourning east a while longer, soon I travel toward you, to remain, to teach robust American love;
For I know very well that I and robust love belong among you, inland, and along the Western Sea;
For These States tend inland, and toward the Western Seaâ€”and I will also.
&amp;mdash;Walt Whitman
 Nice motto for the homeland.</description>
