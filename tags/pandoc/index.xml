      <description>This is not a workflow post. I don&amp;rsquo;t normally post about process or things related to my workflow because, having tried in the past, have concluded that it is more of a procrastination tactic than anything else. Even my post about switching to Hugo for webhosting was written for me rather than anyone else.
You don&amp;rsquo;t care about my workflow. You have your own. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to know how I produce what I do.</description>
