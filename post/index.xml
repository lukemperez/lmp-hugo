&lt;p&gt;The sadness I feel now as I write this is that he won’t get to see the ways he changed and is changing the discipline. He won’t get to see how his intellectual offspring flourish. I’m sad that he won’t continue to make us all a little better. He’s right about a lot of things, including how this world treats anyone who isn’t typical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huge loss for the discipline.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quick note for UT undergraduate and graduate students who are interested in National Security. This week, The Clements Center is holding a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.clementscenter.org/events/item/1121-spdf-info&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Student Professional Development Fund Info Session&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;!---more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The short of it is, if you find an unpaid internship in National Security, the Clements Center has funds to help you pay for living expenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.utcpg.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Center for Politics and Governance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Details&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Wednesday, April 19, 5:00&amp;ndash;6:00PM&lt;br /&gt;
Student Activity Center (SAC), Room 1.106&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cryptocurrencies and the decentralized computing networks that power them, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, have become a global phenomenon. The problem is, most people, including policymakers, don&amp;rsquo;t have a deep understanding of how these new networks operate, what they can do, and what risks and opportunities they present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.petervv.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Peter Van Valkenburgh&lt;/a&gt;, Research Director at Coin Center, will explain how cryptocurrencies work, examine the many policy issues they raise, and discuss the future of this innovative yet disruptive technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event is free and open to the public, but your RSVP is requested. Light refreshments will be served, and parking is available in the Manor Garage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RSVP Today: &lt;a href=&#34;UTCPG419.eventbrite.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;UTCPG419.eventbrite.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The End Strategic Restraint</title>
      <link>https://lukemperez.com/2017/04/the-end-strategic-restraint/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mike Pence says &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2017/04/17/era_of_strategic_patience_is_over_111189.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the era of strategic restraint is over.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pointing to the quarter-century since the United States first confronted North Korea over its attempts to build nuclear weapons, the vice president said a period of patience had followed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But the era of strategic patience is over,&amp;rdquo; Pence declared. &amp;ldquo;President Trump has made it clear that the patience of the United States and our allies in this region has run out and we want to see change. We want to see North Korea abandon its reckless path of the development of nuclear weapons, and also its continual use and testing of ballistic missiles is unacceptable.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always viewed Obama&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;strategic restraint&amp;rdquo; line as hand-waving for &amp;ldquo;we don&amp;rsquo;t really want to do anything about the problem&amp;rdquo;, but it remains unclear at this point whether the Jacksonian impulse is the proper re-engagement on national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;midwest-post-mortem&#34;&gt;Midwest post-mortem&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week I attended the Midwest Political Science Association annual conference in Chicago. AS conferences go, I was pleased with the event and the payoff was well worth the time and energy it cost to attend. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;jss&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;JSS&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, the organizers placed my paper in the &lt;em&gt;Junior Scholar Symposium&lt;/em&gt; (JSS), which is not an actual paper presentation but a round-table seminar. Each presenter is obligated to read the papers of everyone else and prepare feedback. Also, rather than a chair and discussant, two discussants are assigned who are senior scholars in the field. My paper, &amp;ldquo;For (God and) Country&amp;rdquo;, examines the rise of international religious freedom as an objective of U.S. foreign policy. What I presented was essentially a truncated and distilled version of what is my dissertation. I argue that international religious freedom has long been an integral component to American grand strategy throughout the 20th century. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be more pleased with the process. Our senior discussants were terrific and, at least for me, provided feedback that will help make this project more analytically rigorous than it would otherwise be. Feedback at early stages of projects can often be more helpful because &lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com/5895898&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;thrashing at early stages is easy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to my colleagues who participated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soumi Chatterjee, UCLA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brittnay L. Wood, WSU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fernanda B. Almedia, WSU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussants:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Christopher, F. Gelpi, Ohio State&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vinicius R. Vieria, Princeton&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;latino-caucus-networking&#34;&gt;Latino Caucus &amp;amp; Networking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some years ago, I applied for a travel grant for Latino scholars. I wanted to go to Rome and hit some archives on Augustine for my master&amp;rsquo;s thesis at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www1.villanova.edu/villanova/artsci/psc.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Villanova&lt;/a&gt;. What I didn&amp;rsquo;t know was that the Latino Caucus exists primarily to help promote scholarship on Latino politics&amp;mdash;but that didn&amp;rsquo;t stop them from funding part of my airfare. And although my work has never fit with the prevailing interests of the Caucus, I have nevertheless been thankful for their support over the years. So I do my best to pay it forward, and in doing so I have made a number of acquaintances and friendships over the years. This year was no exception. I met &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lsu.edu/hss/polisci/graduate_students/graduate_students/vitelag.php&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Gaby Vitela&lt;/a&gt;, who is doing some interesting work on campaign finance in her dissertation. On Saturday, we attempted to hit up a joint that does Pizza Pot Pies but when we arrived to learn that the wait was 2+ hours, we called an audible. Still, the afternoon let us commiserate with a former classmate of hers and talk all things job market (this fall!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;seminary-co-op&#34;&gt;Seminary Co-Op&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much could be said about this wonderful gem. I never made it to the original bookstore, but I wanted to see it, finally. It&amp;rsquo;s beautiful: one could get lost in wonderful collection of literature, philosophy, and social science collections. It&amp;rsquo;s a masterpiece.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Su on International Religious Freedom</title>
      <link>https://lukemperez.com/2017/01/su-on-international-religious-freedom/</link>

      <guid>https://lukemperez.com/2017/01/su-on-international-religious-freedom/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wonderful new book, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674286023&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exporting Freedom&lt;/em&gt; (Anna Su 2016)&lt;/a&gt;, on the rise of religious freedom in American foreign policy. Anna Su looks at the construction of the international legal regime during the 20th century and finds that the efforts of promoting international religious freedom long predate the Jackson-Vanik Amendment. Although I&amp;rsquo;m skeptical that some of the early cases could rightly be read into the history of American foreign policy regarding religious freedom, I am open to persuasion and, more importantly, she didn&amp;rsquo;t write this book on the grand strategy of international religious freedom. If she had, I&amp;rsquo;d be back to the drawing board for a dissertation topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strongly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My 2010 Macbook Pro finally died. I was hoping to get one more year so I could finish the PhD on the same machine I began it with, but alas. While setting up my new machine, I realized how much I benefited from having my &lt;code&gt;.emacs&lt;/code&gt; file on GitHub. So here&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/lukemperez/.emacs&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;link in case anyone finds it helpful&lt;/a&gt;. A note of caution that it is a work-in-progress and some of the features are not fully active (like RefTeX) but I&amp;rsquo;ve been too busy with the dissertation to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Close the loops</title>
      <link>https://lukemperez.com/2016/10/close-loops/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 03 Oct 2016 08:30:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://lukemperez.com/2016/10/close-loops/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week I presented a best practices workshop on project management for my fellow graduate students. The purpose was to provide younger students in the program with ideas and concepts for managing projects &amp;ldquo;from idea to publication&amp;rdquo;. Preparing my presentation for the workshop afforded me the opportunity to reflect on the principles of productivity that I&amp;rsquo;ve learned over the years. Despite claims to the contrary, both from within and without, the academe is not unlike many other professions: it a profession fundamentally about knowledge work but with functionally infinite demands on otherwise scarce time and attention. For graduate students in particular, productivity wastes are especially pernicious because they are so deceptive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This problem arises from a basic failure to see project
management as anxiety management. Uncompleted tasks and to-do lists, or worse, half-hearted to-do lists, create a cognitive load on the mind that destroys the ability to concentrate and get into what Cal Newport calls &lt;em&gt;deep work&lt;/em&gt;. This isn&amp;rsquo;t the right space to outline the basics of GTD or any task management system; but whatever system one uses will work better if we realize the end goal is to free up the mental bandwidth to concentrate more deeply and more frequently to do the work that matters to us most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/lukemperez/Project-Mgt-Short-Course&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Links to my files for my part of the workshop are here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hello Hugo</title>
      <link>https://lukemperez.com/2016/05/hello-hugo/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;farewell-squarespace&#34;&gt;Farewell Squarespace&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve hosted my webpage on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.squarespace.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Squarespace&lt;/a&gt; since sometime in my second
year at UT Austin. After several years on the platform, I have nothing
but praise for the folks at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.squarespace.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Squarespace&lt;/a&gt;: their reputation for
up-time, customer service, and all around technical bad-assery is well
deserved. If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a web-hosting/web-design company
wherein you can build a beautiful looking site &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; knowing &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt;
HTML, CSS, or anything of that stuff&amp;mdash;and I do mean it: without
any&amp;mdash;then you cannot go wrong with a Squarespace site. But for me,
the time has come to say goodbye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why leave? If I&amp;rsquo;ve been so happy with Squarespace why make the fuss? I
could list a lot of reasons ranging from technical curiosity to summer
boredom or whatever. But really it comes down to handful of several
small but significant reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blog as text files (esp. in Markdown)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Needs of modern academics (syntax highlighting, e.g.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cost of hosting (esp. for a graduate student)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reproducability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;blogging-as-public-scholarship&#34;&gt;Blogging as public scholarship&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d love to blog, er, post more &amp;ldquo;note&amp;rdquo; on teaching and learning (i.e.,
scholarship) but Squarespace requires new posts come from within the
browser. Sure, I could open Safari, go to my blog, click on new
content, write a new post, and push it to website with a simplicity
that only reinforces everything I&amp;rsquo;ve said above about why
non-programming professionals should take a serious look at the
platform. But Squarespace is a closed system. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even export
my content from their blog except into a Wordpress XML format. Which
raises an interesting question why they make support for Markdown in
the first place, since the whole point of Markdown, as I understand
it, is to have human readable plain text files that can be converted
into HTML when needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;modern-academic&#34;&gt;Modern Academic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Related to the first item is the need to integrate other tools of
modern researchers. Whether it is linking to a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; repo or
conceptualizing blog posts as markdown files, working with a variety
of open source tools have become every more integrated into the
workflow of good scholarship. And although Squarespace can do some of
those things, it is now much easier for me to work in an ecosystem of
open, rather than closed systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I need a few things that are not easy to do on their blogging
module. First, as I begin to use R, Python, and other such programming
tools, I need a way to work on a file in Markdown using code blocks to
show my work and then easily convert that &lt;a href=&#34;http://plain-text.co/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;plain-text&lt;/a&gt; file into
HTML, PDF, or LaTeX as my needs require. Such a workflow is possible
using MS Word, Squarespace, and other tools, but they are not the ones
I use. (I&amp;rsquo;ve not &lt;strong&gt;installed&lt;/strong&gt; Microsoft Word on any computer I&amp;rsquo;ve
owned since 2009 or so.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;costs-of-hosting&#34;&gt;Costs of hosting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s face it, graduate students make little to nothing. Every dollar
counts. When I started graduate school, I saw paying for my domain
name as a &lt;em&gt;sine qua non&lt;/em&gt; of a good online presence. But I thought I
could &amp;ldquo;roll my own&amp;rdquo; and avoid paying a monthly hosting fee. I had
tinkered with using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tumblr.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt; but found mixed
results: namely, although the hosting was free and the url could be
custom, the layout was garbage for professional engagement. Eventually
I realized that quality can&amp;rsquo;t faked. I needed a professional looking
site. Squarespace delivered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s changed is that (a) my technical skills are much better than
they were a few years ago and (b) free static hosting on
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.github.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;. Now I can load an entire website to a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; repo
(short for &amp;ldquo;repository&amp;rdquo; if you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar), work a few settings,
and host a website though GitHub. The only catch is that the webpages
must be static rather than dynamic. The difference between the two is
not really a topic for today, but the short of it is that each has
their advantages. Every job needs different tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the ease of which I can manage my website without paying a
monthly fee was enough to finally push me to fill in a few gaps in my
knowledge of website development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;replicate-research-replicate-blogging-replicate-anything&#34;&gt;Replicate research, replicate blogging, replicate anything&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I already mentioned this above:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/205814028-Importing-and-exporting-content&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;exporting on Squarespace&lt;/a&gt;
is not easy. I&amp;rsquo;m still not sure at the time of this drafting if I&amp;rsquo;ll
even get my old blog over. Not that it matters since the friction to
getting a post online kept many a thought, good and bad, from seeing
the digital light of day. Still, it&amp;rsquo;s worth repeating: modern scholars
must be able to reproduce their work. If I can&amp;rsquo;t literally email a
plain text file of my blog post, journal article, or whatever to a
colleague for his or her approval, I&amp;rsquo;m not doing my job right. And
having multiple of versions of the same document in different formats
(HTML, .MD, etc.) only increases the likelihood that at some point one
file will become out of sync with the others being edited. Much easier
to simply version control with git, and push the same file, always in
sync, wherever it needs to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;hello-hugo&#34;&gt;Hello Hugo&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I finally bit the bullet and rebuilt the site as a static webpage
using &lt;a href=&#34;gohugo.io&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; and some thoughts from
&lt;a href=&#34;https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2014/02/24/powered-by-hugo/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Kieran Healy&amp;rsquo;s post about using Hugo&lt;/a&gt;.
I read repeatedly that the process was fast, but I was still surprised
about how fast. Troubleshooting some terminal issues and downloading
Hugo took more time than it did to port my major content into Hugo&amp;rsquo;s
structure. Now I have a mostly hand-built site that relies on me, my
GitHub, and some off the shelf tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll spare you the overview of command to build a site. If you&amp;rsquo;re
reading this and interested in trying it, I suggest reading the docs
at &lt;a href=&#34;gohugo.io&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;. They will certainly be updated by the time that anyone
comes across this post anyway, so there&amp;rsquo;s no need to date my work with
a workflow that will be largely out of date soon anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do recommend, however, spending some time thinking about what themes
for webpage layouts you like best. A lot of folks mistaken conclude
they must build every last piece of code on their websites for it to
really look &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; or for them to say with confidence they have HTML
skills on their CVs and Resumes. But if you think of website themes, which are
built on CSS, as the webpage equivalent to a LaTeX documentclass or
&lt;code&gt;.sty&lt;/code&gt; file, you&amp;rsquo;ll realize there isn&amp;rsquo;t much difference between the
two and, more importantly, no need to completely re-invent the wheel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So three cheers to Squarespace for getting me this far and three more
for &lt;a href=&#34;gohugo.io&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.github.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;when-am-i-going-to-use-this&#34;&gt;When Am I Going to Use This&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rebecca Eggenschwiler on the crux of the matter. Students never really ask &amp;ldquo;when am I going to use this?&amp;rdquo; honestly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the question itself — &amp;ldquo;When am I going to use this?&amp;rdquo; — is nearly always a lie, a front. The asker is not genuinely contemplating the use-value of Material X; rather, he or she is merely announcing the intent to give up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important that as educators we recognize what&amp;rsquo;s really at stake when asked this question by anyone. If we value our product, i.e., that &amp;ldquo;thing,&amp;rdquo; which we are teaching then we must be ready to defend it&amp;rsquo;s value, &lt;em&gt;for its own sake&lt;/em&gt;.

      <title>AcWriMo should be every month</title>

      <description>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;let-s-write&#34;&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s Write&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hashtags for #NaNoWriMo (National Novel Write Month) are starting to populate my twitter feed; yet conspicuously absent thus far are those for academics, affectionately hacked to #AcWriMo. Although #AcWriMo does not begin until November, often in this final week of October, blogs, academic websites and e-journals begin posting on the theme, writing up tips on how to take advantage of #AcWriMo. This year, now that I recently begun my dissertation prospectus and studying for a prelim exam on international politics, I wanted to jump start my writing by making a public commitment to regular writing during November.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What always appealed to me about #AcWriMo was a commitment to writing on a regular basis, its determination to show that academics can, indeed, write. It does not take a lot of effort to find scores of books on academic writing, blog posts on the stress aspiring academics feel about the process, and simple so-called hacks. In reality, writing is as easy&amp;mdash;which is to say, not complex. Just sit down and do the work, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stevenpressfield.com/do-the-work/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Andrew Pressfield style&lt;/a&gt;. I readily admit that it took me a while to figure out how to do that in practice, long after I grasped the lesson intellectually. But, and this seems key to me: The lizard brain has no clothes on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how do I make #AcWriMo a success? As I see it there are several key aspects, all rooted in goal setting literature: clear, realistic, attainable, measurable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;clear-realistic-attainable&#34;&gt;Clear, realistic, attainable&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s be honest, with my schedule as a new father, reading for prelims, teaching demands, and the need to sleep, eat, and relax, 50,000 words is an unrealistic goal this month. But even if it were, a flat number does not add an more clarity or realism than &amp;ldquo;I will write at my desk every day before I leave for class&amp;rdquo;. The obvious follow up question that everyone should be asking is, &amp;ldquo;write on what?&amp;rdquo;. Is it all on the dissertation prospectus? Ok, well, a prospectus might only be 20,000&amp;mdash;25,000 words. My prelim practice answers? How can I even know how much to write when half the work is reading the literature (which is used to &lt;em&gt;write up&lt;/em&gt; summaries on scholars and themes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With my other commitments in life, there is only so much time each day&amp;mdash;which varies on the day&amp;mdash;that I can write. I&amp;rsquo;ll need to integrate writing into my calendar, much like my other hard commitments, paying close attention to my energy level for the time of day, time allowed, and so forth. Much like saying I&amp;rsquo;m going to pull a &lt;a href=&#34;http://stephenking.com/library/nonfiction/on_writing:_a_memoir_of_the_craft.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Steven King&lt;/a&gt; and write 3,000 words every day, saying that I&amp;rsquo;ll write for 3 hours every Tuesday when I teach, have class, office hours, and meetings is unlikely. I do my best to greater and lesser degrees of following a &lt;a href=&#34;http://gettingthingsdone.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;GTD&lt;/a&gt; workflow, which means that I can and should do weekly reviews of my writing. This review should only evaluate what I accomplished each week, but, &lt;em&gt;more importantly&lt;/em&gt; set smaller goals for the week ahead. These goals should also include what reading needs to get done so that continue to build my literature review for both the prospectus as well as the prelim studying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;take-aways&#34;&gt;Take aways&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set a realistic goal for my aims.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate writing into my calendar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use GTD weekly review to clarify my writing goals each week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;realistic-attainable-goals-clearly-defined-in-measurable-terms&#34;&gt;Realistic, attainable goals, clearly defined in measurable terms.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, #AcWriMo should be every month. The project is praiseworthy but anyone seeking to take advantage of it should be thinking about how they will integrate a disciplined writing schedule into their lives beyond November. That is my aim. For now, however, I&amp;rsquo;ll start with clear goals for the month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overall I aim to write 30,000 words composed across several writing projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For my prospectus, I aim to write at least 10,000 words.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For my prelim studying, I aim to write at least 15,000 words&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For all other writing projects, including blog posts and Op-Eds (published or not), I aim to write at least 5,000 words.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This works out to at least 1,000 words every day for the month of November. I readily admit there will be some days when I will neither schedule nor attempt to write and others when I will write more than 1,000 words (which is actually easier to do than most academics think, it seems to me).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Virtual APSA</title>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;would-a-conference-by-any-other-name-smell-as-sweet&#34;&gt;Would a conference by any other name smell as sweet?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week the American Political Science Association (APSA) cancelled it annual conference which was to be held in New Orleans because of Hurricane/Tropical Storm Isaac.  As as result, thousands of faculty, ABD interviewees, and other attendees suddenly had to think about practical implications of a year without the major conference. In their announcement about the cancellation, APSA suggested that all papers uploaded to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ssrn.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SSRN&lt;/a&gt; (a public database where scholarly papers can be downloaded), would count for purposes of CV inclusion. This announcement caused Jacob Levy to remark on twitter, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jtlevy/status/241657580726935552&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;‘count to whom?’&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;and with good reason. The norms of peer review and conference paper presentation, while not codified in law, typically require that a paper is, well, actually presented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it became clear that conference was not going to happen, political science faculty and grad students who are active on twitter began talking about “#virtualAPSA2012” (tweeting comments with that hash tag for others to find our comments and interact in the discussion) as one possible way to address the issues created by the cancellation of APSA. Dan Nexon, who blogs at Duck of Minerva and I were uncoordinated in our efforts but effectively were promoting the same idea: use the Web 2.0 technologies to give individual presentations or hold cancelled panels on Google+ Hangout and broadcast the discussion live with links to the video afterward. The idea was that by using emergent technologies we could replicate to some degree one of the major benefits of presenting at a conference: a public presentation of one’s paper, comments and feedback from other panelists and attendees, and a long term record of what occurred. Eventually, Phil Arena posted audio of his presentation with slides. He was followed by a video from Robert Farley, and again by Jane E. Fountain, who chaired her originally scheduled panel (albeit with a few missing presenters who couldn’t make it). I scheduled and ‘chaired’ an ad hoc panel with Robert Oprisko of Butler and William Winecoff of UNC. (Links to these and other virtual APSA events &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lukemperez.com/virtualapsa2012&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;can be found here&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;disclosure: this is a page on my personal site that I am hosting until APSA goes live with a page that will include both the ‘events’ already listed but also allow political science departments to list mini-APSA conferences that took place over the weekend and are still ongoing.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing isn’t that the handful of scholars actually pulled off an ad hoc mini conference via the web, nor even that APSA took note and is building an official site for it. What is truly interesting, and worth consideration, are the long term implications that Web 2.0 is having, and will have, on scholarly discourse. In other words, the events of #virtualAPSA2012 hint at ways in which Web 2.0 will introduce change into the academy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spoke with Phil Arena and Dan Nexon over email and their share my skepticism that events like virtual APSA will supplant the major conference. One of the greatest benefits to conferencing isn’t so much the presentation of individual papers but the larger networking and informal conversations that take place between panels. There are many reasons why virtual conferences and presentations are not going to become the norm. The obvious one is scale. I don’t have the numbers, but APSA gets thousands of attendees, perhaps tens of thousands. The participants in #virtualAPSA2012 measure in the dozens; and even if we include the mini-conferences held over the weekend and into this week, those combined numbers pale in comparison to the numbers who would have attended APSA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But where virtual APSA was small, it was influential and more engaging. The intimacy of Web 2.0 helps scholars overcome the challenge of accessibility. Arena commented that “[perhaps] this is just because of the highly technical nature of my work, but I find it very difficult to get people to engage my arguments in any depth.” He extends this skepticism to the virtual conference, noting that viewership of a virtual panel or presentation is likely going to be from the very same people who will attend a panel in person. As a result, he thinks that social media outlets are likely not going to increase or enhance dialogue because in each case, the conversation is between the select group of scholars who are already familiar with the work. Although this observation seems accurate, it isn’t hard to see how a virtual presentation implies potential changes for the norms of the academy. Video and audio presentations will exist as long as the internet does. Like regular conference presentations, web presentations are limited to the highlights of a specific paper: the thesis, the data, and the conclusions. In a way, they are similar to abstracts for published papers. Unlike abstracts, they are records of papers yet to be published, if at all. And unlike conference presentations, they can be viewed again and again long after the conference took place. Archived presentations will offer scholars to point to truncated versions of their larger research agendas. Future researchers will be able to track the development of a project, inquire why a project was modified and abandoned, and may be able to revise previously discarded projects as new data or methods become available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long term value of new social media technologies goes beyond being able to hold an ad hoc conversations when a conference is cancelled because of &lt;a href=&#34;http://eoimages.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/imagerecords/79000/79008/isaac_tmo_2012241_lrg.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;a little rain&lt;/a&gt;. In the long view, Web 2.0 will eventually have a profound impact on scholarship because of the ease at which we will hold hold mini-conferences, present early drafts of their paper, or hold informal discussions between them and others engaged in like research. There is also no requirement that these be publicly broadcast if some choose to have private chats (instead of email), but the real utility will be in public video. Consider the potential in posting a video with the slides of a specific paper a week or two before a conference. Skeptics may argue that doing so will depress attendance of a specific panel because there is no longer the incentive to attend in person. And yet, on the other hand, presentations that provoke ideas and interest of others may increase attendance if those within a particular subfield want to engage the author in person. These and other technologies, if used well, will help enhance the fruitfulness of conferences by shaping the scope and depth of the conversations before a conference even begins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These changes are not with out their challenges. Chief among them is quality control. Since anyone can write a blog or get a twitter account, there are very little control mechanisms compared to the peer review process of submitting a paper to a journal or even presenting at a conference. How then is the academy going to evaluate good research and discard bad? One suggestion is to view the order of peer review as reversed: rather than submit a paper to be evaluated, with the conclusion that published papers have met some threshold of quality, researchers may simply publish to the web and be evaluated after. This arrangement suggests that not the rank and influence of a publication itself but the quantity and quality of citations will become the ultimate arbiter of a specific paper or research agenda. This suggestion means more work for academics as the workload of review will become dispersed throughout an entire discipline or subfield; but it also implies more opportunity for new work to influence particular fields because good work will travel more quickly throughout the personal networks of scholars as they talk and discuss about what they have been reading. Another challenge worth consideration is the way in which we scholars will record and track publications on CVs and other archives. Certainly it would be both problematic and counter productive to list every blog post on one’s CV. But since academics have already begun citing webpages and articles in their research (as evidenced by the changes in academic style manuals to account for the practice), at some point influential blog posts, podcasts, and other digital publications will need to be refereed or otherwise evaluated as worthy both to include on the CV and considered when making hiring, tenure, and promotion decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though young academics and other advocates of Web 2.0 technologies are prone to claim that technology is revolutionizing the academy, such claims overstate the case. Instead, they will introduce incremental change that solves problems with coordinating research while introducing new challenges to be solved. The academy, like most institutions, is slow to adopt change; but this is not a criticism. Part of the reason institutions do, and the real benefit, is that slow adaptation allows those within a profession time to adapt and integrate new tools into their work. Best practices have time to be evaluated, revised and discarded as needed in order to accommodate the norms within research traditions. Change, then, is best seen as an organic process. The events of #virtualAPSA2012 were, on the whole, minor in the grand scope of the academy, but they do hint at possibilities to come.&lt;/p&gt;
