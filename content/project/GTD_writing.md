# Summary

A short course taught at the Department of Government at the
University of Texas at Austin. GitHub Repo includes handout and links
of suggested readings (and viewings) on time management, creativity,
and best practices. I emphasized the *iterative* nature of writing,
stressing the need to manage the shallow work of email, meetings, and
the like so that one can focus un-distracted on the Deep Work of
writing, coding, and problem solving.
