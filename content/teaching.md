## Spring 2018: Introduction to American and Texas Government
This course provides an introduction to American and Texas politics. The
class will examine the American political system and explore the
fundamental interaction between liberty and equality both as designed
and as experienced in every day political life. The course will also
examine these themes in the Texas context and present them in a
comparative perspective where appropriate.

Course topics include an introduction to America’s constitutional
foundations, federalism, the functions of institutions (Congress,
Presidency, Courts), Political Economy, and Public Policy. In addition
to mastering these introductory topics, students will learn about
politics as a problem of strategy. The course will include occasional
use of formal games designed to compliment the primary text readings.

## ETC3550: Applied Forecasting for Business and Economics

Reliable forecasts of business and economic variables must often be obtained against a backdrop of structural change in markets and the economy. This unit introduces methods suitable for forecasting in these circumstances including the decomposition of time series, exponential smoothing methods, ARIMA modelling, and regression with auto-correlated disturbances. Students can expect to enhance their computer skills with exercises using R.

## ETC3580: Advanced statistical modelling

This unit introduces extensions of linear regression models for handling a wide variety of data analysis problems. Three extensions will be considered: generalised linear models for handling counts and binary data; mixed-effect models for handling data with a grouped or hierarchical structure; and non-parametric regression for handling non-linear relationships. All computing will be conducted using R.
