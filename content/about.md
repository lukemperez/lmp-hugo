I am an Assistant Professor in the [School of Civic and Economic Thought and Leadership](https://scetl.asu.edu) at Arizona State. Prior to that I was a postdoctoral fellow at the [Kinder Institute](https://democracy.missouri.edu/). I completed my doctoral work at [Texas](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/government/).

Broadly, my work examines US grand strategy and decision-making. More narrowly, it examines strategic leadership, or the intersection of strategy and ethics. My full CV can be found at the above link. Prior to Texas, I worked at the Jack Miller Center and am a 12 year veteran of the Air National Guard where I served as a avionics maintainer. I earned my B.A. at The Ohio State University and M.A. at Villanova University.

My [personal-family blog](https://micro.lukemperez.com) is linked for those who know me personally; professional colleagues will find the posts mundane, I suspect. I am (occasionally) on Twitter, but your best to find me at LinkedIn and Academia, both linked in the sidebar.
