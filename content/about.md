I am an Assistant Professor in the [School of Civic and Economic Thought and Leadership](https://scetl.asu.edu) at Arizona State. Prior to that I was a postdoctoral fellow at the [Kinder Institute on Constitutional Democracy](https://democracy.missouri.edu/) at Missouri. I completed my doctoral work at [UT-Austin](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/government/).

Broadly, my work examines US grand strategy and decision-making. More narrowly, it examines strategic leadership, or the intersection of strategy and ethics. My full CV can be found at the above link. Prior to Texas, I worked at the Jack Miller Center and am a 12 year veteran of the Air National Guard where I served as a avionics maintainer. I earned my B.A. at The Ohio State University and M.A. at Villanova University.

You can connect with me in various ways:

- I use [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lukemperez), more than I should, but not as much as others. I post both both professional and personal things there. 

- For family and friends, my [personal-family blog](https://micro.lukemperez.com) is where I try to post most of the best and recent updates.

- For colleagues, try [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukemperez/) and [Academia](https://asu.academia.edu/lukemperez). (I don't use either service much, and in a perfect world, wouldn't use the latter. Alas.)
