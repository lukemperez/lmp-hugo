I am an Assistant Professor in the [School of Civic and Economic Thought and Leadership](https://scetl.asu.edu) at Arizona State. Prior to that I was a postdoctoral fellow at the [Kinder Institute on Constitutional Democracy](https://democracy.missouri.edu/) at Missouri. I completed my doctoral work at [UT-Austin](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/government/).

Broadly, my work examines US grand strategy and decision-making. More narrowly, it examines strategic leadership, or the intersection of strategy and ethics. My full CV can be found at the above link. Prior to Texas, I worked at the Jack Miller Center and am a 12 year veteran of the Air National Guard where I served as a avionics maintainer. I earned my B.A. at The Ohio State University and M.A. at Villanova University.
