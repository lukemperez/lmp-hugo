# Biography

I am a doctoral candidate in Government at the University of Texas with research interests in religion, ethics, and American foreign policy. I am also an aspiring coffee aficionado, part-time audiophile, and photography
hobbyist.

You can find links to all my major social media profiles. I predominately tweet about politics and national security issues and use the remaining websites for personal work.
