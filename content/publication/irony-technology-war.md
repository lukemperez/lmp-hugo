abstract = "Few technological advancments in war-making have been as welcomed by policymakers and unsettling for ethicists as Unmanned Arieal Vehicals (drones). Although they enhance the state's ability to project force while exercising greater non-combatant discrimination, drones have upset other categories of just war theory. As a result, scholars have begun resurrecting classical international relations theorists looking for insight into contemporary moral challenges. Reinhold Niebuhr has been a key figure in the classical realist renewal because of his work on morality and war. Niebuhr critiqued the ironic tendency in technological societies to create new weapons and procedures, falsly believing each would help strengthen international peace when, in fact, such advancements often restrict the moral agency of policymakers. I argue that rereading Niebuhrian thought is an instructive and worthy endeavor because of its potential to shed new light to the ethical problems surrounding drone warfare and international relations theory."
