Mike Pence says [the era of strategic restraint is over.](http://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2017/04/17/era_of_strategic_patience_is_over_111189.html)

> Pointing to the quarter-century since the United States first confronted North Korea over its attempts to build nuclear weapons, the vice president said a period of patience had followed.

> "But the era of strategic patience is over," Pence declared. "President Trump has made it clear that the patience of the United States and our allies in this region has run out and we want to see change. We want to see North Korea abandon its reckless path of the development of nuclear weapons, and also its continual use and testing of ballistic missiles is unacceptable."

I always viewed Obama's "strategic restraint" line as hand-waving for "we don't really want to do anything about the problem", but it remains unclear at this point whether the Jacksonian impulse is the proper re-engagement on national security.
