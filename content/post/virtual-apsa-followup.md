## Concept

In light of Hurricane Isaac, the American Political Science Association [cancelled](http://www.apsanet.org/content_82576.cfm?navID=988) its annual meeting scheduled to be held in New Orleans, LA. But with all these conference papers dressed up with nowhere to go, a small collection of faculty, graduate students, publishers, and the APSA decided to post our papers and give our presentations anyway. What follows is the Virtual Program for \#virtualAPSA2012 

A shameless credit claiming here, [my tweet may have been the first to start it all](https://twitter.com/lukemperez/status/240459967788896256). I post here for my own recollection later than anything else.
