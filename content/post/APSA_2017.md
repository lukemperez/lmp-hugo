Heading to 'Frisco for APSA this week.^[NB: I use this term 'frisco' not without some reservation as I know locals of San Francisco loath it with a fiery passion of a 1000 suns. But as a native of Southern California, I couldn't resist.] Not much planned save for flurry of job market interviews and meetings with old colleagues, advisors, and friends. To be sure, I planned this trip not without some degree of trepidation. It's a lot of money to plan for a conference and since I'm not presenting, I am ineligible for reimbursement within my department. Of course, I suspect this job market project is similar to nearly any field: new suit, flights, hotels, etc., etc., etc. 

Time to get this whole find a job ball rolling.
