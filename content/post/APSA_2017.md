Heading to 'Frisco for APSA this week.^[I use this term 'frisco' not without some reservation as I know locals of San Francisco loath it with a fiery passion of a 1000 suns. But as a native of Southern California, I couldn't resist.] Not much planned save for flurry of job market interviews and meetings with old colleagues, advisors, and friends. Time to get this whole find a job ball rolling.
