Antonio Garcia-Martinez, at his Substack, [The Pull Request](https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/the-holy-church-of-christ-without):

> The point isn’t the predictive power of the scientific hypothesis, but how it gets actionably internalized as religious doctrine: It’s possible to speak of objective empirical realities religiously and mythically, and that’s mostly what we do. Note how many climate-change discussions fixate on the flooding aspect of global warming (among the last of the effects we’ll actually see), flooding being a near-universal myth seen everywhere from Native American origin stories to the Greeks, the Hindus, numerous Mesopotamian traditions, and (of course) Genesis.

Reminds me of something I wrote for [Providence Mag](https://providencemag.com/2018/04/jacksonian-progressive-american-foreign-policy-anti-theology-response-michael-doran-f%20irst-things/) a few years back about the secular shift in modern American foreign policy.
