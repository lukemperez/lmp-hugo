Wonderful new book, [*Exporting Freedom* (Anna Su 2016)](http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674286023), on the rise of religious freedom in American foreign policy. Anna Su looks at the construction of the international legal regime during the 20th century and finds that the efforts of promoting international religious freedom long predate the Jackson-Vanik Amendment. Although I'm skeptical that some of the early cases could rightly be read into the history of American foreign policy regarding religious freedom, I am open to persuasion and, more importantly, she didn't write this book on the grand strategy of international religious freedom. If she had, I'd be back to the drawing board for a dissertation topic.

Strongly recommended.
