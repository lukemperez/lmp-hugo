[Elliot Cohen chimes in at *The Atlantic*](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/12/harvard-claudine-gay-plagarism-standards/676948/)

> Even if, in the most tolerant and sympathetic of readings, this and similar copying merely constitute “misuse of sources,” it is disqualifying for a position of leadership at any university. Her failure to accept responsibility in stark and unqualified terms makes matters worse.

Concluding... 

> I have no idea how as a teacher at Harvard today I could look an undergraduate in the eye and hold forth about why plagiarism is a violation of the values inherent in the academic enterprise. They would laugh, openly or secretly, at the corruption and double standards. And I would not blame them for doing so.
