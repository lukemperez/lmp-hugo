This is more a place-mark for myself when I invariably need to re-source the tutorials. 

Halfway through 2021, [Github](github.com) changed how users interact with the service in the command line. Instead of authenticating through a username and password, users must now use a [Personal Access Token](https://github.blog/2020-12-15-token-authentication-requirements-for-git-operations/). The upsides in the aggregate are plenty, but mostly centering on better security for everyone. The downside, for infrequent users of Github are that I need to update all my repos. If I just do it all at once, it wouldn't be a problem. But unfortunately, I don't even know where many of them are. I'll run into this problem again. So, I'm linking a few of the tutorials Github put together so I can find it easier in the future.

- [How to make a PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
- [Converting repos login from username-password to PAK](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/managing-remote-repositories#switching-remote-urls-from-ssh-to-https)
