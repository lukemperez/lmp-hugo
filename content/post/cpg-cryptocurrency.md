This week at the [Center for Politics and Governance](http://www.utcpg.org).

**Details**  
Wednesday, April 19, 5:00--6:00PM  
Student Activity Center (SAC), Room 1.106
 
Cryptocurrencies and the decentralized computing networks that power them, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, have become a global phenomenon. The problem is, most people, including policymakers, don't have a deep understanding of how these new networks operate, what they can do, and what risks and opportunities they present. 
 
[Peter Van Valkenburgh](http://www.petervv.com/), Research Director at Coin Center, will explain how cryptocurrencies work, examine the many policy issues they raise, and discuss the future of this innovative yet disruptive technology. 
 
The event is free and open to the public, but your RSVP is requested. Light refreshments will be served, and parking is available in the Manor Garage.
