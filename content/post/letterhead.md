# This is not a workflow post.

I don't normally post about process or things related to my workflow because, having tried in the past, have concluded that it is more of a procrastination tactic than anything else. Even my post about switching to Hugo for webhosting was written for me rather than anyone else.

*You* don't care about my workflow. You have your own. You don't need to know how I produce what I do. I am violating this norm, such as it is, to place a marker down for me that I might use later.

I have been writing a lot of job applications this fall. And as such, I have been sending them out on letterhead. Trouble is, the university I currently work at restricts access to university letterhead for graduate students, *and* the options available are typographically problematic. So after some internet searching I came up with one that works, modified it for my current university and uploaded it as a [repo on Github]().

# A quick and easy Pandoc letterhead

This letterhead has three files:

1. The LaTeX template for Pandoc
2. The makefile
3. A markdown file
