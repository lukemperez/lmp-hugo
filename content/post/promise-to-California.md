> A PROMISE to California,

> Also to the great Pastoral Plains, and for Oregon:

> Sojourning east a while longer, soon I travel toward you, to remain, to teach robust American love;

> For I know very well that I and robust love belong among you, inland, and along the Western Sea;

> For These States tend inland, and toward the Western Seaâ€”and I will also.

> ---Walt Whitman

Nice motto for the homeland. I'll be remembering this as I being the long sojourn through the Ph.D.
