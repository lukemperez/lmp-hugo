Things are getting interesting. As it happens, I assigned students in my course on Grand Strategy broad regions of the globe for which they are responsible: South East Asia, Europe, Latin America, etc. One of their big assignments is a Marshall brief on the region. But they have to give up dates during the term. So we've all been watching this pandemic unfold in more or less real time as it spreads from China to Asia to Europe and the like.

We might as well [roll up the maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Pitt_the_Younger#Second_premiership). I don't think we'll be needing them much longer.
