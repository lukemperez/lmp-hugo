It seems like everyone has new projects during the pandemic. I certainly do. A colleague and I are reading Albert Camus', *The Plague*, and posting our thoughts as a series of podcast. The first is up now [on Podbean](https://pandemicdialogues.podbean.com/e/episode-0-launching-pandemic-dialogues/), and of course, you can easily find them on your favorite podcast app. Additionally, you can find links to the episodes as they are published, [here](https://scetl.asu.edu/pandemic-dialogues#podcast).
