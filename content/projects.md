# Dissertation

## Liberating Faith: international religious freedom and American grand strategy

### Summary

My dissertation investigates the rise of religious liberty in American grand strategy. I begin by noting the empirical oddity of America's international religious freedom agenda vis-a-vis other global powers and argue that religious freedom has long been an integral component to American statecraft. Although religion has recently garnered renewed attention from international relations scholars, the subject remains under-theorized. My project seeks to help us understand more fully how American views of liberty have shaped the efforts to remake and rebuild international order.
